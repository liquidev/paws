/// UI state. This is what's used for laying out groups and drawing to the screen.
///
/// # The group stack
///
/// The group stack is what controls positioning at a given moment. Because paws is an _immediate-mode_ GUI library,
/// there is no intermediate state with nodes and what not. Everything is rendered to the screen directly.
///
/// However, during rendering, paws has to keep some information around for layouting. After all, that's what it's for:
/// laying out rectangles on the screen. The way it maintains this state is through a _stack_ of _groups_.
///
/// Groups are essentially just glorified rectangles with some extra layouting and rendering data. When you push a new
/// group, the its position is placed relative to the previous group, at a vector called the _cursor_. When you pop
/// this new group off the stack, the cursor of the group above is offset by the size of the group you just popped off.
/// This allows you to cascade elements, flexbox-style, just without the overhead of holding a hundred or so nodes
/// scattered across heap memory. The group stack grows as you nest more and more groups inside of each other, but old
/// groups are not preserved after they're popped off the stack.
///
/// Of course this paradigm makes laying out simple panels quite easy, but elements that need to preserve state may be
/// a bit more challenging to implement. But worry not, structs come to your rescue! If you want to implement a more
/// complex element that needs to preserve some state across frames, create a struct that'll hold its data:
///
/// ```
/// // let's assume this is our UI type:
/// use paws::NoRenderer;
/// type Ui = paws::Ui<NoRenderer>;
///
/// struct Slider {
///     value: f32,
///     min: f32,
///     max: f32,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Then, implement a method on this struct that'll render the element onto the screen, and process all incoming input
/// events:
///
/// ```
/// # use paws::NoRenderer;
/// # type Ui = paws::Ui<NoRenderer>;
/// #
/// # struct Slider {
/// #     value: f32,
/// #     min: f32,
/// #     max: f32,
/// # }
/// #
/// use paws::Layout;
///
/// impl Slider {
///     // for brevity, we'll assume no input events need to be processed, as that's outside
///     // of paws's scope.
///     fn process(&mut self, ui: &mut Ui, width: f32) {
///         // create a group that'll span a rectangle with the provided width and the parent
///         // group's height
///         ui.push((width, ui.height()), Layout::Freeform);
///         ui.draw(|ui| {
///             // ... do all the rendering work here ...
///         });
///         ui.pop();
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Then, simply keep a Slider somewhere outside of your event loop, and call `process()` when you want to place it
/// onto your UI.
///

///     slider.process(&mut ui, 256.0);

///
/// # Initialization
///
/// Most of the group-related methods described below will panic if there are no groups on the stack, with the exception
/// of [`Ui::new`] (obviously), and [`Ui::root`]. The latter is used to initialize the UI state so that at least one
/// group is present, but also to make sure that the group stack doesn't grow to oblivion if the user forgets to pop a
/// group or two. (This isn't a good excuse for not popping groups, but it'll at least prevent your program from leaking
/// memory if you really do forget.)
///
/// # Panicking
///
/// All functions that mention the "current group" are guaranteed to panic if there are no groups on the stack.
/// Other groups, such as the "parent group", which is the group above the current group, may also appear, but are
/// always followed up with a Panicking section that specify the requirements for these groups' presence.
///
/// # Rendering
///
/// Because there's usually no use to using a UI library without any actual rendering, the [`Ui`] type takes an extra
/// _renderer_ type as a parameter. The methods from this type are available via the `Deref` and `DerefMut` traits,
/// except for names that collide with those defined on `Ui` itself (obviously).
/// The renderer can be retrieved as an immutable reference (for probing and measurements) using [`Ui::renderer`],
/// and as a mutable reference (for doing actual rendering) using [`Ui::render`].
///
/// # `build!`
///
/// For your convenience while building UIs, a macro is available to make all those `push`es and `pop`s get out of your
/// face. See [`build!`]'s documentation for more info.
